`mille‚Äëfeuille` acts as an orchestrator when running sampling, learning and optimisation loops against expensive MPI-parallelised HPC codes. For optimisation, `mille‚Äëfeuille` is a thin wrapper on top of [**BoTorch**](https://botorch.org/), providing the necessary interface between simulators, surrogates and optimisers.

> **Status:** early days ‚Äì very much a work in progress

## üîß Install

Pip:

```bash
# Development head
pip install git+https://github.com/aidancrilly/mille-feuille.git
```

Or clone repo and install dev environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aidancrilly/mille-feuille.git
cd mille-feuille
pip install -e .[dev]
python dev_fetch_deps.py # Grabs header file needed by C++ test script
```

Requires **Python¬†‚â•‚ÄØ3.11**. Core dependencies (`botorch`, `gpytorch`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `h5py`, `scikit‚Äëlearn` ‚Ä¶) are pulled in automatically.

## üöÄ Quick‚Äëstart

Take a look at the examples directory and sub-directories within:

* *test_executables*: simple (fortran90 and C++) examples implemented for the test suite.
* *loops*: example scripts which use `mille‚Äëfeuille` to perform sampling, learning and optimisation tasks. This example includes a template for a simulator with namelist based input and scheduling within a PBS environment.

## Core components

### Domains, States and Surrogates

`mille‚Äëfeuille` implements the following containers:

1. *InputDomain* holds the bounded input domain which can be a mix of continuous and discrete dimension
2. *FidelityDomain* holds information regarding the degrees of simulation fidelity.
3. *State* holds the necessary data taken from simulation samples: indices (Is), inputs (Xs), output parameters (Ps), fidelities (Ss) and objectives (Ys)

These classes hold the necessary information to train surrogate models. `mille‚Äëfeuille` has a number of abstract base classes as well as concrete examples of surrogate models including Gaussian Processes (using GPyTorch and BOTorch) and Neural Network Ensembles (using PyTorch and BOTorch).

### Simulators and Schedulers

`mille‚Äëfeuille` implements abstract base classes to interact with generic executable simulators. These follow a simple design pattern that simulators are expected to follow:

1. External input files are written based on the candidate X values
2. Batches of the (mpiexec'ed) simulator are launched via a Scheduler
3. The simulator writes output files which must be post-processed to extract useful information (P) and the objective function value (Y)
4. (Optionally) A clean up of the Simulator and Schedular output files is performed

Take a look at the examples and the tests to see implementations of Simulators and Schedulers.
