`mille‑feuille` acts as an orchestrator when running sampling, learning and optimisation loops against expensive MPI-parallelised HPC codes. For optimisation, `mille‑feuille` is a thin wrapper on top of [**BoTorch**](https://botorch.org/), providing the necessary interface between simulators, surrogates and optimisers.

> **Status:** early days – very much a work in progress

## 🔧 Install

Pip:

```bash
# Development head
pip install git+https://github.com/aidancrilly/mille-feuille.git
```

Or clone repo and install dev environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aidancrilly/mille-feuille.git
cd mille-feuille
pip install -e .[dev]
python dev_fetch_deps.py # Grabs header file needed by C++ test script
```

Requires **Python ≥ 3.11**. Core dependencies (`botorch`, `gpytorch`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `h5py`, `scikit‑learn` …) are pulled in automatically.

## 🚀 Quick‑start

Take a look at the examples directory and sub-directories within:

* *test_executables*: simple (fortran90 and C++) examples implemented for the test suite.
* *loops*: example scripts which use `mille‑feuille` to perform sampling, learning and optimisation tasks. This example includes a template for a simulator with namelist based input and scheduling within a PBS environment.

## Core components

### Domains, States and Surrogates

`mille‑feuille` implements the following containers:

1. *InputDomain* holds the bounded input domain which can be a mix of continuous and discrete dimension
2. *FidelityDomain* holds information regarding the degrees of simulation fidelity.
3. *State* holds the necessary data taken from simulation samples: indices (Is), inputs (Xs), output parameters (Ps), fidelities (Ss) and objectives (Ys)

These classes hold the necessary information to train surrogate models. `mille‑feuille` has a number of abstract base classes as well as concrete examples of surrogate models including Gaussian Processes (using GPyTorch and BOTorch) and Neural Network Ensembles (using PyTorch and BOTorch).

### Simulators and Schedulers

`mille‑feuille` implements abstract base classes to interact with generic executable simulators. These follow a simple design pattern that simulators are expected to follow:

1. External input files are written based on the candidate X values
2. Batches of the (mpiexec'ed) simulator are launched via a Scheduler
3. The simulator writes output files which must be post-processed to extract useful information (P) and the objective function value (Y)
4. (Optionally) A clean up of the Simulator and Schedular output files is performed

Take a look at the examples and the tests to see implementations of Simulators and Schedulers.

## 📊 Dashboard

`mille‑feuille` ships with an interactive Streamlit dashboard for inspecting optimisation state, surrogate quality, and optimal-design landscapes.

### Install

```bash
pip install millefeuille[dashboard]
# or, from a local clone:
pip install -e .[dashboard]
```

### Launch

```bash
# From anywhere (installed as a console script)
mf-dashboard

# Custom port
mf-dashboard --server.port 8502

# On a remote server (SSH-forwarded) — headless mode is on by default
mf-dashboard --server.port 8501
```

Then on your **local machine** forward the port over SSH:

```bash
ssh -L 8501:localhost:8501 user@remote-host
```

and open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

### Tabs

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Scatter** | Select any two state columns as axes, optionally colour by a third |
| **Corner Plot** | Corner plot of inputs coloured by objective, with a Y-threshold slider |
| **Cross-Validation** | k-fold CV of the chosen surrogate with truth-vs-prediction and residual plots |
| **Optimal Design** | Sweep each input while optimising the others — shows how Y* depends on each variable |
